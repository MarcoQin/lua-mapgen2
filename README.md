# lua-mapgen2
mapgen2 lua version (not perfect..)

Lua implementation by Marco Qin. Pretty much a 1:1
translation of a wonderful map generating algorthim by Amit Patel of Red Blob Games,
which can be found here [http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/)

But unfortunately, this implementation is not work that perfect, which means the lua version has some bugs that I don't have inough time to fix.

Lukily it works well if you only want to generate simple "Radial" shape, "Square" point type map.

The "main.lua" is a "love2d" example, which show the gallery of "Radial Square" type map...
